<!-- We propose a novel implicit neural representation with flexible spectral-bias tuning for representing and optimizing signals. The repo contains the codes for `image fitting`, `sdf fitting & evaluation`, `ntk visualization`.

For the SDF and NeRF experiments, we utilized the codes of [Bacon](https://github.com/computational-imaging/bacon) and [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp), respectively. For the neural tangent kernel (NTK) visualization, we utilized the code of [inr_dictionaries](https://github.com/gortizji/inr_dictionaries). -->
We introduce a novel implicit neural representation that allows for flexible tuning of the spectral bias, enhancing signal representation and optimization. ðŸš€

This repository provides the code for several applications:

* **Image Fitting:** Demonstrates the model's ability to represent 2D images.
* **SDF Fitting & Evaluation:** Includes code for fitting signed distance functions and evaluating the results, based on the [**Bacon**](https://github.com/computational-imaging/bacon) repository.
* **NeRF Implementation:** Our NeRF experiments are built upon the [**torch-ngp**](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp) codebase.
* **NTK Visualization:** We utilize code from [**inr_dictionaries**](https://github.com/gortizji/inr_dictionaries) to visualize the neural tangent kernel, offering insights into the model's behavior.
